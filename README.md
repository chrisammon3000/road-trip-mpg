# Data from RoadTrip for iOS

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Background
I have been tracking each fillup since about 2011 using this app. In that time I have taken a few cross-country trips, bought and sold 2 cars and moved states. The analysis currently contains a thorough EDA and will soon have some geospatial data included. 

## Questions
- Is fuel efficiency better or worse depending on season?
- Where have I been?
- Where is gas cheapest and most expensive?
- What is the farthest I have driven in 24 hours since I began collecting data?

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Seaborn & Matplotlib

## Needs of this project

- Convert folder structure to reproducible workflow
- Add geospatial analysis
- Modeling & Cluster analyses
